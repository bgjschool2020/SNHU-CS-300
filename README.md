# SNHU-CS-300
This is a repository of all work done in my CS-300 class at SNHU.


### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We looked at several types of sorting algorithms in this course. There was an assignment each week that taught a new type of sorting. For the projects, we had to parse and sort a csv file of some "courses" from a university. Each of these courses had a course ID (ex: CSCI101), name (ex: Introduction to Programming in C++), and prerequisites(ex: CSCI100).

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I chose to sort using a binary search tree. This was likely excessive, as just sorting within the vector would have been much quicker to implement, but I thought that was too easy and wanted to attempt something different. 

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I ran into some issues using a CSVParser file that was provided to us from a previous assignment. When gathering data from the csv, it was ignoring the first line, as that would normally be a header. The file we were provided did not include a header line so I had to find the sections of the code that were dealing with the header and remove them for this assignment. 

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
In Project One we had to create Pseudocode for Project Two. The work I did in Project One was basically irrelevant because I hadn't looked at what the requirements for the second project were. This made Project One excessively long and I hardly looked at it for the actual coding part of the assignment. In the future, I will look at the requirements for the project so I can plan better.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I mostly looked at the past assignments from the semester. If I didn't directly copy functions that I had used in them, I adapted them for this project. In the future, I will create programs that will allow me to do this, with small easy to adapt functions, if only to save myself some time.
